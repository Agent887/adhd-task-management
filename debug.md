### Completed Work
1. Enhanced the `AnalyticsService` with comprehensive `generateInsights` method
   - Added multi-timeframe analysis (day, week, month)
   - Implemented insights for completion rates, peak hours, cognitive load, context switching, and energy patterns
   - Each insight includes type, title, description, confidence level, and actionable suggestions

2. Updated main router configuration
   - Added analytics router to main router
   - Mounted at `/api/analytics/*`
   - Protected with authentication middleware

3. Completed analytics endpoint testing
   - Implemented tests for successful analytics retrieval
   - Added error handling test cases
   - Verified default parameter behavior

4. Implemented Analytics Frontend Components
   - Created InsightCard for displaying productivity insights
   - Added MetricCard for key metrics visualization
   - Implemented PerformanceChart for daily patterns
   - Added CognitiveLoadChart for load distribution
   - Created EnergyPatternChart for energy tracking

5. Set up Load Testing Infrastructure
   - Added k6 for load testing
   - Created analytics load test scenarios
   - Configured test thresholds and stages

### Current State
- Analytics endpoint (`/api/analytics`) is fully functional
- Frontend components are implemented and ready for integration
- Load testing infrastructure is set up
- Ready to begin user acceptance testing

### Next Steps
1. Run and analyze load tests
2. Begin user acceptance testing
   - Create test scenarios
   - Set up test environment
   - Recruit test users
3. Start mobile support implementation
   - Set up Progressive Web App
   - Optimize UI for mobile devices
   - Implement offline functionality

### Open Questions
- Do we need to add caching for analytics data?
- Should we implement rate limiting for analytics endpoints?
- Consider adding export functionality for analytics data

### Files Modified
- `src/services/analytics_service.ts`
- `src/routes/index.ts`
- `src/routes/analytics.ts`
- `src/components/analytics/*` (new components)
